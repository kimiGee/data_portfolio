## Exploratory Analysis: [Population Decline of the North American Monarch Butterfly](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CzXsc1hnqlfzHiIvUzSVXInCFUHq7B06?usp=sharing#scrollTo=P_eOZY6NlYnJ)

The purpose of the Western Monarch count is to assess the status of the western monarch butterfly population in a region along the Pacific Coast that extends from Mendocino, California to Northern Baja, Mexico.  The count has been conducted annually since 1997 during the species' overwintering period which extends from October through March.  Sharp declines in their numbers have been observed in recent years that seemed to indicate a stressor on the population.  One theory suggests the decline in the overwintering population is due to the loss of agricultural milkweeds due to the near-ubiquitous use of glyphosate herbicides. Data in the host plant counts does seem to suggest a correlation between this and the decline in monarch counts.<br><br>
